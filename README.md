#  Neural Architecture Search


This repository contains the code and resources for the study utilizing Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to optimize deep learning models for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) datasets. ESG indicators are crucial for evaluating company practices, and this research aims to enhance the accuracy, interpretability, and explainability of ESG classification models.

By leveraging advanced NAS techniques, this project analytically explores various neural network architectures to find the most effective model for ESG analytics. The results demonstrate significant improvements in model performance, providing a robust tool for ESG analysis and informed decision-making in sustainability practices.
